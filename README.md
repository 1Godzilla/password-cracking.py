Here’s a README.md file for a password-cracking script. This README includes a description of the tool, setup instructions, usage, and some notes on ethical considerations.

Password Cracking Tool

This Python-based password-cracking script demonstrates how to use brute-force and dictionary attacks to attempt password cracking. It is intended for educational purposes, helping cybersecurity professionals and students understand password vulnerabilities and common attack methods.

Features

	•	Brute-Force Attack: Attempts to crack a password by systematically trying all possible combinations within a given character set.
	•	Dictionary Attack: Attempts to crack a password by trying each entry in a provided wordlist file.
	•	Customizable Character Sets: Supports adjustable character sets, such as letters, numbers, and special characters, for brute-force attacks.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x

Setup

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-cracking-tool.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd password-cracking-tool


	3.	Install any necessary libraries (if your script uses external libraries, e.g., for hashing):

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Add a requirements.txt file if any libraries are needed.)

Usage

Brute-Force Attack

To run a brute-force attack:

python password_cracking.py --mode brute-force --charset abcdef1234 --maxlength 4

	•	–mode: Selects the attack mode (brute-force or dictionary).
	•	–charset: Character set to use (e.g., abcdef1234).
	•	–maxlength: Maximum password length to attempt.

Dictionary Attack

To run a dictionary attack:

python password_cracking.py --mode dictionary --wordlist path/to/wordlist.txt

	•	–wordlist: Path to the wordlist file containing potential passwords.

Example

Attempting to crack password with brute-force attack...
Password cracked: "pass123"
